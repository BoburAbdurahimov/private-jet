                <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-4">Pilot Training and Certification</h2>
                <p>
                  Private jet pilots undergo extensive training and certification processes that often exceed commercial airline requirements. They must maintain current certifications, undergo regular medical examinations, and participate in ongoing training programs to ensure peak performance.
                </p>

                <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-4">Aircraft Maintenance and Inspections</h2>
                <p>
                  Private aircraft are subject to rigorous maintenance schedules and inspections that ensure optimal performance and safety. Every component is regularly checked, tested, and replaced according to strict manufacturer guidelines and regulatory requirements.
                </p>

                <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-4">Weather Monitoring and Decision Making</h2>
                <p>
                  Private jet operations include sophisticated weather monitoring systems and decision-making protocols. Pilots have access to real-time weather data and make informed decisions about flight safety, including delays or route changes when necessary.
                </p>

                <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-4">Emergency Procedures and Equipment</h2>
